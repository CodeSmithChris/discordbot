# discordbot
Repo for Discord Bot production

## Goals:
Current implementation of the bot should allow for users to self-assign roles.
Depending on the server this will allow users to access certain channels based on permissions to keep a cleaner server

## Stylistic options
Create a post and assign roles based on user emoji reactions
Create / command with options to allow for assignment of roles
